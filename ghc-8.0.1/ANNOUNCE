           ===============================================
            The Glasgow Haskell Compiler -- version 8.0.1
           ===============================================

The GHC Team is pleased to announce a new super-major release of GHC. This is
the most significant GHC release in quite some time, including both a number
of major features and numerous bug fixes. These include,

 * The TypeInType extension, which unifies types and kinds, allowing GHC
   to reason about kind equality and enabling promotion of GADTs to the type
   level.

 * Support for record pattern synonyms

 * The -XDeriveAnyClass extension learned to derive instances for classes with
   associated types

 * More reliable DWARF debugging information

 * Support for injective type families

 * Applicative do-notation

 * Support for wildcards in data and type family instances

 * Strict and StrictData extensions, allowing modules to be compiled with
   strict-by-default bindings

 * The DuplicateRecordFields extensions, allowing multiple datatypes to declare
   the same record field names provided they are used unambiguously

 * Support for implicit parameters providing light-weight callstacks and source
   locations

 * User-defined error messages for type errors

 * A rewritten (and greatly improved) pattern exhaustiveness checker

 * GHCi can run the interpreter in a separate process, and the interpreter can
   now run profiled code

 * A native code generator for powerpc64 and powerpc64le architectures

 * and more!

A more thorough list of the changes in the release can be found in the release

How to get it
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The easy way is to go to the web page, which should be self-explanatory:

        http://www.haskell.org/ghc/

We supply binary builds in the native package format for many
platforms, and the source distribution is available from the same
place.

Packages will appear as they are built - if the package for your
system isn't available yet, please try again later.


Background
~~~~~~~~~~

Haskell is a standard lazy functional programming language.

GHC is a state-of-the-art programming suite for Haskell.  Included is
an optimising compiler generating efficient code for a variety of
platforms, together with an interactive system for convenient, quick
development.  The distribution includes space and time profiling
facilities, a large collection of libraries, and support for various
language extensions, including concurrency, exceptions, and foreign
language interfaces. GHC is distributed under a BSD-style open source license.

A wide variety of Haskell related resources (tutorials, libraries,
specifications, documentation, compilers, interpreters, references,
contact information, links to research groups) are available from the
Haskell home page (see below).


On-line GHC-related resources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relevant URLs on the World-Wide Web:

Supported Platforms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The list of platforms we support, and the people responsible for them,
is here:

Ports to other platforms are possible with varying degrees of
difficulty.  The Building Guide describes how to go about porting to a
new platform:

Developers
~~~~~~~~~~

We welcome new contributors.  Instructions on accessing our source
code repository, and getting started with hacking on GHC, are
available from the GHC's developer's site run by Trac:

  http://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/


Mailing lists
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We run mailing lists for GHC users and bug reports; to subscribe, use
the web interfaces at

There are several other haskell and ghc-related mailing lists on
www.haskell.org; for the full list, see
