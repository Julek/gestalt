Various types used during typechecking, please see TcRnMonad as well for
operations on these types. You probably want to import it, instead of this
module.

All the monads exported here are built on top of the same IOEnv monad. The
monad functions like a Reader monad in the way it passes the environment
around. This is done to allow the environment to be manipulated in a stack
like fashion when entering expressions... ect.

For state that is global and should be returned at the end (e.g not part
of the stack mechanism), you should use an TcRef (= IORef) to store them.

-- Note [Signature parameters in TcGblEnv and DynFlags]
-- ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-- When compiling signature files, we need to know which implementation
-- we've actually linked against the signature.  There are three seemingly
-- redundant places where this information is stored: in DynFlags, there
-- is sigOf, and in TcGblEnv, there is tcg_sig_of and tcg_impl_rdr_env.
-- Here's the difference between each of them:
--
-- * DynFlags.sigOf is global per invocation of GHC.  If we are compiling
--   with --make, there may be multiple signature files being compiled; in
--   which case this parameter is a map from local module name to implementing
--   Module.
--
-- * HscEnv.tcg_sig_of is global per the compilation of a single file, so
--   it is simply the result of looking up tcg_mod in the DynFlags.sigOf
--   parameter.  It's setup in TcRnMonad.initTc.  This prevents us
--   from having to repeatedly do a lookup in DynFlags.sigOf.
--
-- * HscEnv.tcg_impl_rdr_env is a RdrEnv that lets us look up names
--   according to the sig-of module.  It's setup in TcRnDriver.tcRnSignature.
--   Here is an example showing why we need this map:
--
--  module A where
--      a = True
--
--  module ASig where
--      import B
--      a :: Bool
--
--  module B where
--      b = False
--
-- When we compile ASig --sig-of main:A, the default
-- global RdrEnv (tcg_rdr_env) has an entry for b, but not for a
-- (we never imported A).  So we have to look in a different environment
-- to actually get the original name.
--
-- By the way, why do we need to do the lookup; can't we just use A:a
-- as the name directly?  Well, if A is reexporting the entity from another
-- module, then the original name needs to be the real original name:
--
--  module C where
--      a = True
--
--  module A(a) where
--      import C

{- Note [Tracking unused binding and imports]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We gather two sorts of usage information

 * tcg_dus (defs/uses)
      Records *defined* Names (local, top-level)
          and *used*    Names (local or imported)

      Used (a) to report "defined but not used"
               (see RnNames.reportUnusedNames)
           (b) to generate version-tracking usage info in interface
               files (see MkIface.mkUsedNames)
   This usage info is mainly gathered by the renamer's
   gathering of free-variables

 * tcg_used_gres
      Used only to report unused import declarations

      Records each *occurrence* an *imported* (not locally-defined) entity.
      The occurrence is recorded by keeping a GlobalRdrElt for it.
      These is not the GRE that is in the GlobalRdrEnv; rather it
      is recorded *after* the filtering done by pickGREs.  So it reflect
      /how that occurrence is in scope/.   See Note [GRE filtering] in
      RdrName.

Note [The Global-Env/Local-Env story]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During type checking, we keep in the tcg_type_env
        * All types and classes
        * All Ids derived from types and classes (constructors, selectors)

At the end of type checking, we zonk the local bindings,
and as we do so we add to the tcg_type_env
        * Locally defined top-level Ids

Why?  Because they are now Ids not TcIds.  This final GlobalEnv is
        a) fed back (via the knot) to typechecking the
           unfoldings of interface signatures
        b) used in the ModDetails of this module

{- Note [Given Insts]
   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Because of GADTs, we have to pass inwards the Insts provided by type signatures

        f :: Eq a => T a -> Bool
        f (T1 x y) = [x]==[y]

The constructor T1 binds an existential variable 'b', and we need Eq [b].
Well, we have it, because Eq a refines to Eq [b], but we can only spot that if we
pass it inwards.

-- Arrow-notation context
---------------------------

{- Note [Escaping the arrow scope]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In arrow notation, a variable bound by a proc (or enclosed let/kappa)
is not in scope to the left of an arrow tail (-<) or the head of (|..|).
For example

        proc x -> (e1 -< e2)

Here, x is not in scope in e1, but it is in scope in e2.  This can get
a bit complicated:

        let x = 3 in
        proc y -> (proc z -> e1) -< e2

Here, x and z are in scope in e1, but y is not.

We implement this by
recording the environment when passing a proc (using newArrowScope),
and returning to that (using escapeArrowScope) on the left of -< and the
head of (|..|).

All this can be dealt with by the *renamer*. But the type checker needs
to be involved too.  Example (arrowfail001)
  class Foo a where foo :: a -> ()
  data Bar = forall a. Foo a => Bar a
  get :: Bar -> ()
  get = proc x -> case x of Bar a -> foo -< a
Here the call of 'foo' gives rise to a (Foo a) constraint that should not
be captured by the pattern match on 'Bar'.  Rather it should join the
constraints from further out.  So we must capture the constraint bag
from further out in the ArrowCtxt that we push inwards.

{- Note [Bindings with closed types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider

  f x = let g ys = map not ys
        in ...

Can we generalise 'g' under the OutsideIn algorithm?  Yes,
because all g's free variables are top-level; that is they themselves
have no free type variables, and it is the type variables in the
environment that makes things tricky for OutsideIn generalisation.

Definition:
   A variable is "closed", and has tct_closed set to TopLevel,
iff
   a) all its free variables are imported, or are let-bound with closed types
   b) generalisation is not restricted by the monomorphism restriction

Invariant: a closed variable has no free type variables in its type.

Under OutsideIn we are free to generalise a closed let-binding.
This is an extension compared to the JFP paper on OutsideIn, which
used "top-level" as a proxy for "closed".  (It's not a good proxy
anyway -- the MR can make a top-level binding with a free type
variable.)

Note that:
  * A top-level binding may not be closed, if it suffers from the MR

  * A nested binding may be closed (eg 'g' in the example we started with)
    Indeed, that's the point; whether a function is defined at top level
    or nested is orthogonal to the question of whether or not it is closed

  * A binding may be non-closed because it mentions a lexically scoped
    *type variable*  Eg
        f :: forall a. blah
        f x = let g y = ...(y::a)...

Note [Binding scoped type variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The type variables *brought into lexical scope* by a type signature may
be a subset of the *quantified type variables* of the signatures, for two reasons:

* With kind polymorphism a signature like
    f :: forall f a. f a -> f a
  may actually give rise to
    f :: forall k. forall (f::k -> *) (a:k). f a -> f a
  So the sig_tvs will be [k,f,a], but only f,a are scoped.
  NB: the scoped ones are not necessarily the *inital* ones!

* Even aside from kind polymorphism, there may be more instantiated
  type variables than lexically-scoped ones.  For example:
        type T a = forall b. b -> (a,b)
        f :: forall c. T c
  Here, the signature for f will have one scoped type variable, c,
  but two instantiated type variables, c' and b'.

The function findScopedTyVars takes
  * hs_ty:    the original HsForAllTy
  * sig_ty:   the corresponding Type (which is guaranteed to use the same Names
              as the HsForAllTy)
  * inst_tvs: the skolems instantiated from the forall's in sig_ty
It returns a [(Maybe Name, TcTyVar)], in 1-1 correspondence with inst_tvs
but with a (Just n) for the lexically scoped name of each in-scope tyvar.

Note [sig_tau may be polymorphic]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Note that "sig_tau" might actually be a polymorphic type,
if the original function had a signature like
   forall a. Eq a => forall b. Ord b => ....
But that's ok: tcMatchesFun (called by tcRhs) can deal with that
It happens, too!  See Note [Polymorphic methods] in TcClassDcl.

Note [Existential check]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Lazy patterns can't bind existentials.  They arise in two ways:
  * Let bindings      let { C a b = e } in b
  * Twiddle patterns  f ~(C a b) = e
The pe_lazy field of PatEnv says whether we are inside a lazy
pattern (perhaps deeply)

If we aren't inside a lazy pattern then we can bind existentials,
but we need to be careful about "extra" tyvars. Consider
    (\C x -> d) : pat_ty -> res_ty
When looking for existential escape we must check that the existential
bound by C don't unify with the free variables of pat_ty, OR res_ty
(or of course the environment).   Hence we need to keep track of the
res_ty free vars.

Note [Complete and partial type signatures]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A type signature is partial when it contains one or more wildcards
(= type holes).  The wildcard can either be:
* A (type) wildcard occurring in sig_theta or sig_tau. These are
  stored in sig_wcs.
      f :: Bool -> _
      g :: Eq _a => _a -> _a -> Bool
* Or an extra-constraints wildcard, stored in sig_cts:
      h :: (Num a, _) => a -> a

A type signature is a complete type signature when there are no
wildcards in the type signature, i.e. iff sig_wcs is empty and
sig_extra_cts is Nothing. -}

Note [Hole constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CHoleCan constraints are used for two kinds of holes,
distinguished by cc_hole:

  * For holes in expressions (including variables not in scope)
    e.g.   f x = g _ x

  * For holes in type signatures
    e.g.   f :: _ -> _
           f x = [x,True]

Note [CIrredEvCan constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
CIrredEvCan constraints are used for constraints that are "stuck"
   - we can't solve them (yet)
   - we can't use them to solve other constraints
   - but they may become soluble if we substitute for some
     of the type variables in the constraint

Example 1:  (c Int), where c :: * -> Constraint.  We can't do anything
            with this yet, but if later c := Num, *then* we can solve it

Example 2:  a ~ b, where a :: *, b :: k, where k is a kind variable
            We don't want to use this to substitute 'b' for 'a', in case
            'k' is subequently unifed with (say) *->*, because then
            we'd have ill-kinded types floating about.  Rather we want
            to defer using the equality altogether until 'k' get resolved.

Note [Ct/evidence invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If  ct :: Ct, then extra fields of 'ct' cache precisely the ctev_pred field
of (cc_ev ct), and is fully rewritten wrt the substitution.   Eg for CDictCan,
   ctev_pred (cc_ev ct) = (cc_class ct) (cc_tyargs ct)
This holds by construction; look at the unique place where CDictCan is
built (in TcCanonical).

In contrast, the type of the evidence *term* (ccev_evtm or ctev_evar/dest) in
the evidence may *not* be fully zonked; we are careful not to look at it
during constraint solving.  See Note [Evidence field of CtEvidence]

{- Note [Dropping derived constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In general we discard derived constraints at the end of constraint solving;
see dropDerivedWC.  For example

 * If we have an unsolved [W] (Ord a), we don't want to complain about
   an unsolved [D] (Eq a) as well.

 * If we have [W] a ~ Int, [W] a ~ Bool, improvement will generate
   [D] Int ~ Bool, and we don't want to report that because it's incomprehensible.
   That is why we don't rewrite wanteds with wanteds!

But (tiresomely) we do keep *some* Derived insolubles:

 * Insoluble kind equalities (e.g. [D] * ~ (* -> *)) may arise from
   a type equality a ~ Int#, say.  In future they'll be Wanted, not Derived,
   but at the moment they are Derived.

 * Insoluble derived equalities (e.g. [D] Int ~ Bool) may arise from
   functional dependency interactions, either between Givens or
   Wanteds.  It seems sensible to retain these:
   - For Givens they reflect unreachable code
   - For Wanteds it is arguably better to get a fundep error than
     a no-instance error (Trac #9612)

 * Type holes are derived constraints because they have no evidence
   and we want to keep them so we get the error report

Moreover, we keep *all* derived insolubles under some circumstances:

  * They are looked at by simplifyInfer, to decide whether to
    generalise.  Example: [W] a ~ Int, [W] a ~ Bool
    We get [D] Int ~ Bool, and indeed the constraints are insoluble,
    and we want simplifyInfer to see that, even though we don't
    ultimately want to generate an (inexplicable) error message from

To distinguish these cases we use the CtOrigin.

{- Note [When superclasses help]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First read Note [The superclass story] in TcCanonical.

We expand superclasses and iterate only if there is at unsolved wanted
for which expansion of superclasses (e.g. from given constraints)
might actually help. The function superClassesMightHelp tells if
doing this superclass expansion might help solve this constraint.
Note that

  * Superclasses help only for Wanted constraints.  Derived constraints
    are not really "unsolved" and we certainly don't want them to
    trigger superclass expansion. This was a good part of the loop
    in  Trac #11523

  * Even for Wanted constraints, we say "no" for implicit paramters.
    we have [W] ?x::ty, expanding superclasses won't help:
      - Superclasses can't be implicit parameters
      - If we have a [G] ?x:ty2, then we'll have another unsolved
        [D] ty ~ ty2 (from the functional dependency)
        which will trigger superclass expansion.

    It's a bit of a special case, but it's easy to do.  The runtime cost
    is low because the unsolved set is usually empty anyway (errors
    aside), and the first non-imlicit-parameter will terminate the search.

    The special case is worth it (Trac #11480, comment:2) because it
    applies to CallStack constraints, which aren't type errors. If we have
       f :: (C a) => blah
       f x = ...undefined...
    we'll get a CallStack constraint.  If that's the only unsolved
    constraint it'll eventually be solved by defaulting.  So we don't
    want to emit warnings about hitting the simplifier's iteration
    limit.  A CallStack constraint really isn't an unsolved
    constraint; it can always be solved by defaulting.

Note [Needed evidence variables]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Th ic_need_evs field holds the free vars of ic_binds, and all the
ic_binds in nested implications.

  * Main purpose: if one of the ic_givens is not mentioned in here, it
    is redundant.

  * solveImplication may drop an implication altogether if it has no
    remaining 'wanteds'. But we still track the free vars of its
    evidence binds, even though it has now disappeared.

Note [Shadowing in a constraint]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We assume NO SHADOWING in a constraint.  Specifically
 * The unification variables are all implicitly quantified at top
   level, and are all unique
 * The skolem variables bound in ic_skols are all freah when the
   implication is created.
So we can safely substitute. For example, if we have
   forall a.  a~Int => ...(forall b. ...a...)...
we can push the (a~Int) constraint inwards in the "givens" without
worrying that 'b' might clash.

Note [Skolems in an implication]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The skolems in an implication are not there to perform a skolem escape
check.  That happens because all the environment variables are in the
untouchables, and therefore cannot be unified with anything at all,
let alone the skolems.

Instead, ic_skols is used only when considering floating a constraint
outside the implication in TcSimplify.floatEqualities or
TcSimplify.approximateImplications

Note [Insoluble constraints]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of the errors that we get during canonicalization are best
reported when all constraints have been simplified as much as
possible. For instance, assume that during simplification the
following constraints arise:

 [Wanted]   F alpha ~  uf1
 [Wanted]   beta ~ uf1 beta

When canonicalizing the wanted (beta ~ uf1 beta), if we eagerly fail
we will simply see a message:
    'Can't construct the infinite type  beta ~ uf1 beta'
and the user has no idea what the uf1 variable is.

Instead our plan is that we will NOT fail immediately, but:
    (1) Record the "frozen" error in the ic_insols field
    (2) Isolate the offending constraint from the rest of the inerts
    (3) Keep on simplifying/canonicalizing

At the end, we will hopefully have substituted uf1 := F alpha, and we
will be able to report a more informative error:
    'Can't construct the infinite type beta ~ F alpha beta'

Insoluble constraints *do* include Derived constraints. For example,
a functional dependency might give rise to [D] Int ~ Bool, and we must
report that.  If insolubles did not contain Deriveds, reportErrors would
never see it.

Note [Evidence field of CtEvidence]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
During constraint solving we never look at the type of ctev_evar/ctev_dest;
instead we look at the ctev_pred field.  The evtm/evar field
may be un-zonked.

Note [Bind new Givens immediately]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For Givens we make new EvVars and bind them immediately. Two main reasons:
  * Gain sharing.  E.g. suppose we start with g :: C a b, where
       class D a => C a b
       class (E a, F a) => D a
    If we generate all g's superclasses as separate EvTerms we might
    get    selD1 (selC1 g) :: E a
           selD2 (selC1 g) :: F a
           selC1 g :: D a
    which we could do more economically as:
           g1 :: D a = selC1 g
           g2 :: E a = selD1 g1
           g3 :: F a = selD2 g1

  * For *coercion* evidence we *must* bind each given:
      class (a~b) => C a b where ....
      f :: C a b => ....
    Then in f's Givens we have g:(C a b) and the superclass sc(g,0):a~b.
    But that superclass selector can't (yet) appear in a coercion
    (see evTermCoercion), so the easy thing is to bind it to an Id.

So a Given has EvVar inside it rather than (as previously) an EvTerm.

{- Note [eqCanRewrite]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(eqCanRewrite ct1 ct2) holds if the constraint ct1 (a CTyEqCan of form
tv ~ ty) can be used to rewrite ct2.  It must satisfy the properties of
a can-rewrite relation, see Definition [Can-rewrite relation] in
TcSMonad.

With the solver handling Coercible constraints like equality constraints,
the rewrite conditions must take role into account, never allowing
a representational equality to rewrite a nominal one.

Note [Wanteds do not rewrite Wanteds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We don't allow Wanteds to rewrite Wanteds, because that can give rise
to very confusing type error messages.  A good example is Trac #8450.
Here's another
   f :: a -> Bool
   f x = ( [x,'c'], [x,True] ) `seq` True
Here we get
  [W] a ~ Char
  [W] a ~ Bool
but we do not want to complain about Bool ~ Char!

Note [Deriveds do rewrite Deriveds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
However we DO allow Deriveds to rewrite Deriveds, because that's how
improvement works; see Note [The improvement story] in TcInteract.

However, for now at least I'm only letting (Derived,NomEq) rewrite
(Derived,NomEq) and not doing anything for ReprEq.  If we have
    eqCanRewriteFR (Derived, NomEq) (Derived, _)  = True
then we lose property R2 of Definition [Can-rewrite relation]
in TcSMonad
  R2.  If f1 >= f, and f2 >= f,
       then either f1 >= f2 or f2 >= f1
Consider f1 = (Given, ReprEq)
         f2 = (Derived, NomEq)
          f = (Derived, ReprEq)

I thought maybe we could never get Derived ReprEq constraints, but
we can; straight from the Wanteds during improvment. And from a Derived
ReprEq we could conceivably get a Derived NomEq improvment (by decomposing
a type constructor with Nomninal role), and hence unify.

Note [funEqCanDischarge]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have two CFunEqCans with the same LHS:
    (x1:F ts ~ f1) `funEqCanDischarge` (x2:F ts ~ f2)
Can we drop x2 in favour of x1, either unifying
f2 (if it's a flatten meta-var) or adding a new Given
(f1 ~ f2), if x2 is a Given?

Answer: yes if funEqCanDischarge is true.

Note [eqCanDischarge]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we have two identicla equality constraints
(i.e. both LHS and RHS are the same)
      (x1:s~t) `eqCanDischarge` (xs:s~t)
Can we just drop x2 in favour of x1?

Answer: yes if eqCanDischarge is true.

Note that we do /not/ allow Wanted to discharge Derived.
We must keep both.  Why?  Because the Derived may rewrite
other Deriveds in the model whereas the Wanted cannot.

However a Wanted can certainly discharge an identical Wanted.  So
eqCanDischarge does /not/ define a can-rewrite relation in the
sense of Definition [Can-rewrite relation] in TcSMonad.

************************************************************************

Note [SubGoalDepth]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The 'SubGoalDepth' takes care of stopping the constraint solver from looping.

The counter starts at zero and increases. It includes dictionary constraints,
equality simplification, and type family reduction. (Why combine these? Because
it's actually quite easy to mistake one for another, in sufficiently involved
scenarios, like ConstraintKinds.)

The flag -fcontext-stack=n (not very well named!) fixes the maximium
level.

* The counter includes the depth of type class instance declarations.  Example:
     [W] d{7} : Eq [Int]
  That is d's dictionary-constraint depth is 7.  If we use the instance
     $dfEqList :: Eq a => Eq [a]
  to simplify it, we get
     d{7} = $dfEqList d'{8}
  where d'{8} : Eq Int, and d' has depth 8.

  For civilised (decidable) instance declarations, each increase of
  depth removes a type constructor from the type, so the depth never
  gets big; i.e. is bounded by the structural depth of the type.

* The counter also increments when resolving
equalities involving type functions. Example:
  Assume we have a wanted at depth 7:
    [W] d{7} : F () ~ a
  If there is an type function equation "F () = Int", this would be rewritten to
    [W] d{8} : Int ~ a
  and remembered as having depth 8.

  Again, without UndecidableInstances, this counter is bounded, but without it
  can resolve things ad infinitum. Hence there is a maximum level.

* Lastly, every time an equality is rewritten, the counter increases. Again,
  rewriting an equality constraint normally makes progress, but it's possible
  the "progress" is just the reduction of an infinitely-reducing type family.
  Hence we need to track the rewrites.

When compiling a program requires a greater depth, then GHC recommends turning
off this check entirely by setting -freduction-depth=0. This is because the
exact number that works is highly variable, and is likely to change even between
minor releases. Because this check is solely to prevent infinite compilation
times, it seems safe to disable it when a user has ascertained that their program
doesn't loop at the type level.
