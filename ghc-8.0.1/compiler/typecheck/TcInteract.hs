Note [Basic Simplifier Plan]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Pick an element from the WorkList if there exists one with depth
   less than our context-stack depth.

2. Run it down the 'stage' pipeline. Stages are:
      - canonicalization
      - inert reactions
      - spontaneous reactions
      - top-level intreactions
   Each stage returns a StopOrContinue and may have sideffected
   the inerts or worklist.

   The threading of the stages is as follows:
      - If (Stop) is returned by a stage then we start again from Step 1.
      - If (ContinueWith ct) is returned by a stage, we feed 'ct' on to
        the next stage in the pipeline.
4. If the element has survived (i.e. ContinueWith x) the last stage
   then we add him in the inerts and jump back to Step 1.

If in Step 1 no such element exists, we have exceeded our context-stack
depth and will simply fail.

Note [Unflatten after solving the simple wanteds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We unflatten after solving the wc_simples of an implication, and before attempting
to float. This means that

 * The fsk/fmv flatten-skolems only survive during solveSimples.  We don't
   need to worry about them across successive passes over the constraint tree.
   (E.g. we don't need the old ic_fsk field of an implication.

 * When floating an equality outwards, we don't need to worry about floating its
   associated flattening constraints.

 * Another tricky case becomes easy: Trac #4935
       type instance F True a b = a
       type instance F False a b = b

       [w] F c a b ~ gamma
       (c ~ True) => a ~ gamma
       (c ~ False) => b ~ gamma

   Obviously this is soluble with gamma := F c a b, and unflattening
   will do exactly that after solving the simple constraints and before
   attempting the implications.  Before, when we were not unflattening,
   we had to push Wanted funeqs in as new givens.  Yuk!

   Another example that becomes easy: indexed_types/should_fail/T7786
      [W] BuriedUnder sub k Empty ~ fsk
      [W] Intersect fsk inv ~ s
      [w] xxx[1] ~ s
      [W] forall[2] . (xxx[1] ~ Empty)
                   => Intersect (BuriedUnder sub k Empty) inv ~ Empty

Note [Running plugins on unflattened wanteds]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There is an annoying mismatch between solveSimpleGivens and
solveSimpleWanteds, because the latter needs to fiddle with the inert
set, unflatten and zonk the wanteds.  It passes the zonked wanteds
to runTcPluginsWanteds, which produces a replacement set of wanteds,
some additional insolubles and a flag indicating whether to go round
the loop again.  If so, prepareInertsForImplications is used to remove
the previous wanteds (which will still be in the inert set).  Note
that prepareInertsForImplications will discard the insolubles, so we
must keep track of them separately.

{- Note [The solveSimpleWanteds loop]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solving a bunch of simple constraints is done in a loop,
(the 'go' loop of 'solveSimpleWanteds'):
  1. Try to solve them; unflattening may lead to improvement that
     was not exploitable during solving
  2. Try the plugin
  3. If step 1 did improvement during unflattening; or if the plugin
     wants to run again, go back to step 1

Non-obviously, improvement can also take place during
the unflattening that takes place in step (1). See TcFlatten,
See Note [Unflattening can force the solver to iterate]

Note [The Solver Invariant]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We always add Givens first.  So you might think that the solver has
the invariant

   If the work-item is Given,
   then the inert item must Given

But this isn't quite true.  Suppose we have,
    c1: [W] beta ~ [alpha], c2 : [W] blah, c3 :[W] alpha ~ Int
After processing the first two, we get
     c1: [G] beta ~ [alpha], c2 : [W] blah
Now, c3 does not interact with the the given c1, so when we spontaneously
solve c3, we must re-react it with the inert set.  So we can attempt a
reaction between inert c2 [W] and work-item c3 [G].

It *is* true that [Solver Invariant]
   If the work-item is Given,
   AND there is a reaction
   then the inert item must Given
or, equivalently,
   If the work-item is Given,
   and the inert item is Wanted/Derived
   then there is no reaction

Note [Replacement vs keeping]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When we have two Given constraints both of type (C tys), say, which should
we keep?  More subtle than you might think!

  * Constraints come from different levels (different_level_strategy)

      - For implicit parameters we want to keep the innermost (deepest)
        one, so that it overrides the outer one.
        See Note [Shadowing of Implicit Parameters]

      - For everything else, we want to keep the outermost one.  Reason: that
        makes it more likely that the inner one will turn out to be unused,
        and can be reported as redundant.  See Note [Tracking redundant constraints]
        in TcSimplify.

        It transpires that using the outermost one is reponsible for an
        8% performance improvement in nofib cryptarithm2, compared to
        just rolling the dice.  I didn't investigate why.

  * Constaints coming from the same level (i.e. same implication)

       - Always get rid of InstSC ones if possible, since they are less
         useful for solving.  If both are InstSC, choose the one with
         the smallest TypeSize
         See Note [Solving superclass constraints] in TcInstDcls

       - Keep the one that has a non-trivial evidence binding.
            Example:  f :: (Eq a, Ord a) => blah
            then we may find [G] d3 :: Eq a
                             [G] d2 :: Eq a
              with bindings  d3 = sc_sel (d1::Ord a)
            We want to discard d2 in favour of the superclass selection from
            the Ord dictionary.
         Why? See Note [Tracking redundant constraints] in TcSimplify again.

  * Finally, when there is still a choice, use IRKeep rather than
    IRReplace, to avoid unnecessary munging of the inert set.

Doing the depth-check for implicit parameters, rather than making the work item
always overrride, is important.  Consider

    data T a where { T1 :: (?x::Int) => T Int; T2 :: T a }

    f :: (?x::a) => T a -> Int
    f T1 = ?x
    f T2 = 3

We have a [G] (?x::a) in the inert set, and at the pattern match on T1 we add
two new givens in the work-list:  [G] (?x::Int)
                                  [G] (a ~ Int)
Now consider these steps
  - process a~Int, kicking out (?x::a)
  - process (?x::Int), the inner given, adding to inert set
  - process (?x::a), the outer given, overriding the inner given
Wrong!  The depth-check ensures that the inner implicit parameter wins.
(Actually I think that the order in which the work-list is processed means
that this chain of events won't happen, but that's very fragile.)

{-
Note [Shadowing of Implicit Parameters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider the following example:

f :: (?x :: Char) => Char
f = let ?x = 'a' in ?x

The "let ?x = ..." generates an implication constraint of the form:

?x :: Char => ?x :: Char

Furthermore, the signature for `f` also generates an implication
constraint, so we end up with the following nested implication:

?x :: Char => (?x :: Char => ?x :: Char)

Note that the wanted (?x :: Char) constraint may be solved in
two incompatible ways:  either by using the parameter from the
signature, or by using the local definition.  Our intention is
that the local definition should "shadow" the parameter of the
signature, and we implement this as follows: when we add a new
*given* implicit parameter to the inert set, it replaces any existing
givens for the same implicit parameter.

This works for the normal cases but it has an odd side effect
in some pathological programs like this:

-- This is accepted, the second parameter shadows
f1 :: (?x :: Int, ?x :: Char) => Char
f1 = ?x

-- This is rejected, the second parameter shadows
f2 :: (?x :: Int, ?x :: Char) => Int
f2 = ?x

Both of these are actually wrong:  when we try to use either one,
we'll get two incompatible wnated constraints (?x :: Int, ?x :: Char),
which would lead to an error.

I can think of two ways to fix this:

  1. Simply disallow multiple constratits for the same implicit
    parameter---this is never useful, and it can be detected completely
    syntactically.

  2. Move the shadowing machinery to the location where we nest
     implications, and add some code here that will produce an
     error if we get multiple givens for the same implicit parameter.

We never rewrite the RHS (cc_fsk) of a CFunEqCan.  But we /do/ want to

    type family F a b = r | r -> b

Then if we have two CFunEqCan constraints for F with the same RHS
   F s1 t1 ~ rhs
   F s2 t2 ~ rhs
then we can use the injectivity to get a new Derived constraint on
the injective argument
  [D] t1 ~ t2

That in turn can help GHC solve constraints that would otherwise require
guessing.  For example, consider the ambiguity check for
   f :: F Int b -> Int
We get the constraint
   [W] F Int b ~ F Int beta
where beta is a unification variable.  Injectivity lets us pick beta ~ b.

Injectivity information is also used at the call sites. For example:
   g = f True
gives rise to
   [W] F Int b ~ Bool
from which we can derive b.  This requires looking at the defining equations of
a type family, ie. finding equation with a matching RHS (Bool in this example)
and infering values of type variables (b in this example) from the LHS patterns
of the matching equation.  For closed type families we have to perform
additional apartness check for the selected equation to check that the selected
is guaranteed to fire for given LHS arguments.

These new constraints are simply *Derived* constraints; they have no evidence.
We could go further and offer evidence from decomposing injective type-function
applications, but that would require new evidence forms, and an extension to
FC, so we don't do that right now (Dec 14).

See also Note [Injective type families] in TyCon


Note [Cache-caused loops]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It is very dangerous to cache a rewritten wanted family equation as 'solved' in our
solved cache (which is the default behaviour or xCtEvidence), because the interaction
may not be contributing towards a solution. Here is an example:

Initial inert set:
  [W] g1 : F a ~ beta1
Work item:
  [W] g2 : F a ~ beta2
The work item will react with the inert yielding the _same_ inert set plus:
    i)   Will set g2 := g1 `cast` g3
    ii)  Will add to our solved cache that [S] g2 : F a ~ beta2
    iii) Will emit [W] g3 : beta1 ~ beta2
Now, the g3 work item will be spontaneously solved to [G] g3 : beta1 ~ beta2
and then it will react the item in the inert ([W] g1 : F a ~ beta1). So it
will set
      g1 := g ; sym g3
and what is g? Well it would ideally be a new goal of type (F a ~ beta2) but
remember that we have this in our solved cache, and it is ... g2! In short we
created the evidence loop:

        g2 := g1 ; g3
        g3 := refl
        g1 := g2 ; sym g3

To avoid this situation we do not cache as solved any workitems (or inert)
which did not really made a 'step' towards proving some goal. Solved's are
just an optimization so we don't lose anything in terms of completeness of
solving.


Note [Efficient Orientation]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Suppose we are interacting two FunEqCans with the same LHS:
          (inert)  ci :: (F ty ~ xi_i)
          (work)   cw :: (F ty ~ xi_w)
We prefer to keep the inert (else we pass the work item on down
the pipeline, which is a bit silly).  If we keep the inert, we
will (a) discharge 'cw'
     (b) produce a new equality work-item (xi_w ~ xi_i)
Notice the orientation (xi_w ~ xi_i) NOT (xi_i ~ xi_w):
    new_work :: xi_w ~ xi_i
    cw := ci ; sym new_work
Why?  Consider the simplest case when xi1 is a type variable.  If
we generate xi1~xi2, porcessing that constraint will kick out 'ci'.
If we generate xi2~xi1, there is less chance of that happening.
Of course it can and should still happen if xi1=a, xi1=Int, say.
But we want to avoid it happening needlessly.

Similarly, if we *can't* keep the inert item (because inert is Wanted,
and work is Given, say), we prefer to orient the new equality (xi_i ~
xi_w).

Note [Carefully solve the right CFunEqCan]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
   ---- OLD COMMENT, NOW NOT NEEDED
   ---- because we now allow multiple
   ---- wanted FunEqs with the same head
Consider the constraints
  c1 :: F Int ~ a      -- Arising from an application line 5
  c2 :: F Int ~ Bool   -- Arising from an application line 10
Suppose that 'a' is a unification variable, arising only from
flattening.  So there is no error on line 5; it's just a flattening
variable.  But there is (or might be) an error on line 10.

Two ways to combine them, leaving either (Plan A)
  c1 :: F Int ~ a      -- Arising from an application line 5
  c3 :: a ~ Bool       -- Arising from an application line 10
or (Plan B)
  c2 :: F Int ~ Bool   -- Arising from an application line 10
  c4 :: a ~ Bool       -- Arising from an application line 5

Plan A will unify c3, leaving c1 :: F Int ~ Bool as an error
on the *totally innocent* line 5.  An example is test SimpleFail16
where the expected/actual message comes out backwards if we use
the wrong plan.

The second is the right thing to do.  Hence the isMetaTyVarTy
test when solving pairwise CFunEqCan.

{- Note [Avoid double unifications]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The spontaneous solver has to return a given which mentions the unified unification
variable *on the left* of the equality. Here is what happens if not:
  Original wanted:  (a ~ alpha),  (alpha ~ Int)
We spontaneously solve the first wanted, without changing the order!
      given : a ~ alpha      [having unified alpha := a]
Now the second wanted comes along, but he cannot rewrite the given, so we simply continue.
At the end we spontaneously solve that guy, *reunifying*  [alpha := Int]

We avoid this problem by orienting the resulting given so that the unification
variable is on the left.  [Note that alternatively we could attempt to
enforce this at canonicalization]

See also Note [No touchables as FunEq RHS] in TcSMonad; avoiding
double unifications is the main reason we disallow touchable
unification variables as RHS of type family equations: F xis ~ alpha.

When we spot an equality arising from a functional dependency,
we now use that equality (a "wanted") to rewrite the work-item
constraint right away.  This avoids two dangers

 Danger 1: If we send the original constraint on down the pipeline
           it may react with an instance declaration, and in delicate
           situations (when a Given overlaps with an instance) that
           may produce new insoluble goals: see Trac #4952

 Danger 2: If we don't rewrite the constraint, it may re-react
           with the same thing later, and produce the same equality
           again --> termination worries.

To achieve this required some refactoring of FunDeps.hs (nicer
now!).

{- Note [Top-level reductions for type functions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
c.f. Note [The flattening story] in TcFlatten

Suppose we have a CFunEqCan  F tys ~ fmv/fsk, and a matching axiom.
Here is what we do, in four cases:

* Wanteds: general firing rule
    (work item) [W]        x : F tys ~ fmv
    instantiate axiom: ax_co : F tys ~ rhs

   Then:
      Discharge   fmv := alpha
      Discharge   x := ax_co ; sym x2
      New wanted  [W] x2 : alpha ~ rhs  (Non-canonical)
   This is *the* way that fmv's get unified; even though they are
   "untouchable".

   NB: it can be the case that fmv appears in the (instantiated) rhs.
   In that case the new Non-canonical wanted will be loopy, but that's
   ok.  But it's good reason NOT to claim that it is canonical!

* Wanteds: short cut firing rule
  Applies when the RHS of the axiom is another type-function application
      (work item)        [W] x : F tys ~ fmv
      instantiate axiom: ax_co : F tys ~ G rhs_tys

  It would be a waste to create yet another fmv for (G rhs_tys).
  Instead (shortCutReduction):
      - Flatten rhs_tys (cos : rhs_tys ~ rhs_xis)
      - Add G rhs_xis ~ fmv to flat cache  (note: the same old fmv)
      - New canonical wanted   [W] x2 : G rhs_xis ~ fmv  (CFunEqCan)
      - Discharge x := ax_co ; G cos ; x2

* Givens: general firing rule
      (work item)        [G] g : F tys ~ fsk
      instantiate axiom: ax_co : F tys ~ rhs

   Now add non-canonical given (since rhs is not flat)
      [G] (sym g ; ax_co) : fsk ~ rhs  (Non-canonical)

* Givens: short cut firing rule
  Applies when the RHS of the axiom is another type-function application
      (work item)        [G] g : F tys ~ fsk
      instantiate axiom: ax_co : F tys ~ G rhs_tys

  It would be a waste to create yet another fsk for (G rhs_tys).
  Instead (shortCutReduction):
     - Flatten rhs_tys: flat_cos : tys ~ flat_tys
     - Add new Canonical given
          [G] (sym (G flat_cos) ; co ; g) : G flat_tys ~ fsk   (CFunEqCan)

Note [Cached solved FunEqs]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When trying to solve, say (FunExpensive big-type ~ ty), it's important
to see if we have reduced (FunExpensive big-type) before, lest we
simply repeat it.  Hence the lookup in inert_solved_funeqs.  Moreover
we must use `funEqCanDischarge` because both uses might (say) be Wanteds,
and we *still* want to save the re-computation.

Note [MATCHING-SYNONYMS]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
When trying to match a dictionary (D tau) to a top-level instance, or a
type family equation (F taus_1 ~ tau_2) to a top-level family instance,
we do *not* need to expand type synonyms because the matcher will do that for us.


Note [RHS-FAMILY-SYNONYMS]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The RHS of a family instance is represented as yet another constructor which is
like a type synonym for the real RHS the programmer declared. Eg:
    type instance F (a,a) = [a]
Becomes:
    :R32 a = [a]      -- internal type synonym introduced
    F (a,a) ~ :R32 a  -- instance

When we react a family instance with a type family equation in the work list
we keep the synonym-using RHS without expansion.

Note [FunDep and implicit parameter reactions]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, our story of interacting two dictionaries (or a dictionary
and top-level instances) for functional dependencies, and implicit
paramters, is that we simply produce new Derived equalities.  So for example

        class D a b | a -> b where ...
    Inert:
        d1 :g D Int Bool
    WorkItem:
        d2 :w D Int alpha

    We generate the extra work item
        cv :d alpha ~ Bool
    where 'cv' is currently unused.  However, this new item can perhaps be
    spontaneously solved to become given and react with d2,
    discharging it in favour of a new constraint d2' thus:
        d2' :w D Int Bool
        d2 := d2' |> D Int cv
    Now d2' can be discharged from d1

We could be more aggressive and try to *immediately* solve the dictionary
using those extra equalities, but that requires those equalities to carry
evidence and derived do not carry evidence.

If that were the case with the same inert set and work item we might dischard
d2 directly:

        cv :w alpha ~ Bool
        d2 := d1 |> D Int cv

But in general it's a bit painful to figure out the necessary coercion,
so we just take the first approach. Here is a better example. Consider:
    class C a b c | a -> b
And:
     [Given]  d1 : C T Int Char
     [Wanted] d2 : C T beta Int
In this case, it's *not even possible* to solve the wanted immediately.
So we should simply output the functional dependency and add this guy
[but NOT its superclasses] back in the worklist. Even worse:
     [Given] d1 : C T Int beta
     [Wanted] d2: C T beta Int
Then it is solvable, but its very hard to detect this on the spot.

It's exactly the same with implicit parameters, except that the
"aggressive" approach would be much easier to implement.


Note [Weird fundeps]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider   class Het a b | a -> b where
              het :: m (f c) -> a -> m b

           class GHet (a :: * -> *) (b :: * -> *) | a -> b
           instance            GHet (K a) (K [a])
           instance Het a b => GHet (K a) (K b)

The two instances don't actually conflict on their fundeps,
although it's pretty strange.  So they are both accepted. Now
try   [W] GHet (K Int) (K Bool)
This triggers fundeps from both instance decls;
      [D] K Bool ~ K [a]
      [D] K Bool ~ K beta
And there's a risk of complaining about Bool ~ [a].  But in fact
the Wanted matches the second instance, so we never get as far
as the fundeps.

Trac #7875 is a case in point.

Note [Overriding implicit parameters]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Consider
   f :: (?x::a) -> Bool -> a

   g v = let ?x::Int = 3
         in (f v, let ?x::Bool = True in f v)

This should probably be well typed, with
   g :: Bool -> (Int, Bool)

So the inner binding for ?x::Bool *overrides* the outer one.
Hence a work-item Given overrides an inert-item Given.

{- Note [Instance and Given overlap]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Example, from the OutsideIn(X) paper:
       instance P x => Q [x]
       instance (x ~ y) => R y [x]

       wob :: forall a b. (Q [b], R b a) => a -> Int

       g :: forall a. Q [a] => [a] -> Int
       g x = wob x

This will generate the impliation constraint:
            Q [a] => (Q [beta], R beta [a])
If we react (Q [beta]) with its top-level axiom, we end up with a
(P beta), which we have no way of discharging. On the other hand,
if we react R beta [a] with the top-level we get  (beta ~ a), which
is solvable and can help us rewrite (Q [beta]) to (Q [a]) which is
now solvable by the given Q [a].

The solution is that:
  In matchClassInst (and thus in topReact), we return a matching
  instance only when there is no Given in the inerts which is
  unifiable to this particular dictionary.

  We treat any meta-tyvar as "unifiable" for this purpose,
  *including* untouchable ones

The end effect is that, much as we do for overlapping instances, we
delay choosing a class instance if there is a possibility of another
instance OR a given to match our constraint later on. This fixes
Trac #4981 and #5002.

Other notes:

* The check is done *first*, so that it also covers classes
  with built-in instance solving, such as
     - constraint tuples
     - natural numbers
     - Typeable

* The given-overlap problem is arguably not easy to appear in practice
  due to our aggressive prioritization of equality solving over other
  constraints, but it is possible. I've added a test case in
  typecheck/should-compile/GivenOverlapping.hs

* Another "live" example is Trac #10195; another is #10177.

* We ignore the overlap problem if -XIncoherentInstances is in force:
  see Trac #6002 for a worked-out example where this makes a
  difference.

* Moreover notice that our goals here are different than the goals of
  the top-level overlapping checks. There we are interested in
  validating the following principle:

      If we inline a function f at a site where the same global
      instance environment is available as the instance environment at
      the definition site of f then we should get the same behaviour.

  But for the Given Overlap check our goal is just related to completeness of
  constraint solving.

{- Note [Typeable (T a b c)]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For type applications we always decompose using binary application,
vai doTyApp, until we get to a *kind* instantiation.  Exmaple
   Proxy :: forall k. k -> *

To solve Typeable (Proxy (* -> *) Maybe) we
  - First decompose with doTyApp,
    to get (Typeable (Proxy (* -> *))) and Typeable Maybe
  - Then sovle (Typeable (Proxy (* -> *))) with doTyConApp

If we attempt to short-cut by solving it all at once, via
doTyCOnAPp


Note [No Typeable for polytypes or qualified types]
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
We do not support impredicative typeable, such as
   Typeable (forall a. a->a)
   Typeable (Eq a => a -> a)
   Typeable (() => Int)
   Typeable (((),()) => Int)

See Trac #9858.  For forall's the case is clear: we simply don't have
a TypeRep for them.  For qualified but not polymorphic types, like
(Eq a => a -> a), things are murkier.  But:

 * We don't need a TypeRep for these things.  TypeReps are for
   monotypes only.

 * Perhaps we could treat `=>` as another type constructor for `Typeable`
   purposes, and thus support things like `Eq Int => Int`, however,
   at the current state of affairs this would be an odd exception as
   no other class works with impredicative types.
   For now we leave it off, until we have a better story for impredicativity.
